        I graduated Arizona State University in 2019 with a B.S. in Health Sciences (Pre-Professional).
        I am currently undergoing a full-stack web developement bootcamp offered by the University of Arizona which is finishing in November of 2021.
        Along with this, I am approaching my start date for Infosys as an Associate Software Engineer.

        During my free time, I like to play videogames with friends, play volleyball and work on puzzles that train the brain. If I am not doing either of these activities,
        then I am trying to work on various projects to help further my skillsets.
